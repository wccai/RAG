      "User:  I'd like to set up a gaming computer for Black Myth: Wukong\n",
      "AI:  Black Myth: Wukong is an action-adventure game with impressive visuals and demanding system requirements. To set up a gaming computer that can handle it smoothly, I'd recommend considering the following components:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **CPU:** A strong processor with multiple cores will help with multitasking and provide a smooth gaming experience. For Black Myth: Wukong, consider at least an Intel Core i7-12700K or AMD Ryzen 9 5900X.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **GPU:** The graphics card is crucial for the game's performance. An NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 or AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT would be a good choice. If you can afford more, going up to an RTX 3080 or RX 6900 XT would provide even better visuals and performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **RAM:** The game requires at least 16 GB of RAM, but for a smooth experience with all the features turned on, consider using 32 GB (2x16 GB) of DDR5 memory (if your CPU supports it). For older systems that support DDR4, using 32 GB as well will provide ample resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Storage:** A fast NVMe SSD is essential. It can be a single drive for the operating system and games or a combination with a traditional hard drive for storage. Consider at least a 1 TB SSD for the operating system and games.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Monitor & Display Settings:** Make sure your monitor supports the game's resolution and refresh rate. If you're running the game on high settings, consider a display with a high refresh rate (144 Hz or more) for a smoother experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Cooling System:** A good cooling system is necessary to prevent overheating when playing games at full capacity. Consider investing in a powerful liquid cooling setup like the Corsair Hydro H115i RGB Platinum.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Operating System and Drivers:** Ensure your operating system (Windows 11) is up-to-date, and all drivers are updated for your hardware components.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Additional Requirements:** Some games require more resources than others, so be prepared to possibly upgrade other parts down the line if you notice performance dips during extended gaming sessions or with updates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, setting up a gaming computer that can handle demanding games like Black Myth: Wukong requires careful consideration of each component's impact on your system's overall performance. Upgrading hardware over time is often more cost-effective than trying to match the game's current requirements immediately.\n",
      "User:  any recommendations for a school student with a very limited budget?\n",
      "AI:  Setting up a gaming computer for Black Myth: Wukong can be challenging with a limited budget. However, here are some modified recommendations that should help you get started:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. CPU:** Instead of the Intel Core i7-12700K or AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, consider an older-generation processor like the **Intel Core i5-11600K** or **AMD Ryzen 5 5600X**. These processors are still powerful enough to handle Black Myth: Wukong and are more budget-friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. GPU:** For a budget-friendly option, look for a **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060** or **AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT**. While they might not offer the same performance as higher-end GPUs, they should still be able to handle the game at lower graphics settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. RAM:** With 16 GB of DDR4 memory (2x8 GB), you'll have enough RAM for a smooth experience with all features turned on. This is a significant cost reduction compared to the recommended 32 GB.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Storage:** A **1 TB NVMe SSD** should be sufficient for storing your operating system and games. Consider using a traditional hard drive or external storage for other files.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Monitor & Display Settings:** For now, use an existing monitor with a decent refresh rate (60 Hz). As you upgrade your computer in the future, consider investing in a new monitor that supports higher refresh rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. Cooling System:** A basic air cooling system like the **Noctua NH-U12A** or **NZXT Kraken X73** should suffice for now. These systems are more affordable and will help keep your computer cool while gaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "**7. Operating System and Drivers:** Ensure your operating system (Windows 11) is up-to-date, and all drivers are updated for your hardware components.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional Tips:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Use the game's built-in graphics settings to adjust performance according to your hardware.\n",
      "* Consider playing at lower resolutions or disabling some features to improve performance.\n",
      "* Keep an eye out for sales or discounts on gaming hardware, which can help you upgrade individual components as needed.\n",
      "* Prioritize upgrading one component at a time, rather than trying to upgrade everything at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember that building a gaming computer with a limited budget requires patience and flexibility. As your financial situation improves, you'll be able to upgrade specific components to better match the game's requirements.\n"
